How to run the game:
1. run "./gradlew installDist" in the top directory of the project
2. cd into server folder and run "tee src/test/resources/input.txt | ./build/install/server/bin/server | tee src/test/resources/output.txt"
3. when the game states that it is ready, on separate machines/terminals, cd into the client folder for each player.
4. in the client folder, run "tee src/test/resources/input-client-<number>.txt | ./build/install/client/bin/client | tee src/test/resources/output-client-<number>.txt"
The <number> is whatever the number of client is. So, either 1,2,3, or 4. For example, if you are the first player, you should put 1 in place of <number> and likewise for all other players.
